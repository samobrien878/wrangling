        "- Melting data means to turn the columns into rows, many people call it casting data from wide to long.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because there are multiple values in both the columns and the value slots, and many colvars need to be melted together. Table 12 is molten because even though it is mostly clean, the element column has 2 variables in it that need to be melted.\n",
        "8. The chicken and the egg problem is that tidyness of data is limited by the tools to make it tidy. Those tool in return are linked to tidy data, making it very dificult to improve on the process to prep messy data for analysis. Wickham hopes that people will create large concentrated efforts to improve on his tools, to create more consise and efficient methods to tidy data."
